# Project-Analyzing-Students-Mental-Health

### Project Overview

Does going to university in a different country affect your mental health?

A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and published a study the following year that was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.
The study found that **international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population**, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.

To investigate these findings, I utilized PostgreSQL to analyze the study's data, focusing on the potential correlation between international students' length of stay and their average mental health diagnostic scores.

### Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Student's mental.csv" file.

### Tools

SQL - Data Analysis

### EDA

EDA involved exploring the data to answer key question:

Does the length of stay impact the mental health of international students?
